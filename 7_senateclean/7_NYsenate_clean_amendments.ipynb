Contributing to the fund does not reduce taxes owed to\\nthe state.\\n\\nSection 3 adds a new section 99-q to the State Finance Law creating\\nthe volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency services fund in\\nthe joint custody of the Commissioner of Tax and Finance and the\\nComptroller. Authorizes expenditures from the fund for grants to\\nvolunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency service organizations\\nfor the purpose of encouraging the recruitment and retention of\\nvolunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency service personnel.\\nThis section also declares that to the extent possible, the Secretary\\nof the State shall ensure that all monies received during a fiscal\\nyear are expended prior to the end of that fiscal year.\\n\\nSection 4 provides that the act take effect 180 days after it becomes\\na law.\\n\\n JUSTIFICATION :\\nVolunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency services workers are\\ncrucial to the effective operation of a municipality and for the\\nsafety and well-being of the citizens of this state.  Volunteer\\nfirefighters and volunteer emergency services workers provide an\\nincalculable benefit to municipalities. The legislature also finds\\nthat the number of volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency\\nservices workers has declined significantly over the past few years.\\nTherefore, it is the intention of this legislature to help revive\\ninterest in volunteering time to serve as a firefighter or ambulance\\nworker.\\n\\n LEGISLATIVE HISTORY :\\n2007-08: S.2340-A Finance; A.2637-A Passed Assembly\\n2005-06: A.1148-B Ways and Means\\n\\n FISCAL IMPLICATIONS :\\nNone to the State.\\n\\n EFFECTIVE DATE :\\nThis act shall take effect on the one hundredth eightieth day after it\\nshall have become a law.\\n',\n",
