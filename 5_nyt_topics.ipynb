       "'He expressed bewilderment that anyone would think he had done wrong. He defended his skills as a part-time business consultant, even suggesting to the prosecutors sitting nearby that they could benefit from his services. He scoffed at the notion that he had entered office to enrich himself.\\n\\n“I can say to you honestly, as honestly as I can: In my heart, and in my mind, I did nothing wrong,” Mr. Bruno told Judge Gary L. Sharpe of United States District Court. “I didn’t have to go into politics,” he said. “I had a job. I had a business.”\\n\\nBut Judge Sharpe disagreed, sternly reminding Mr. Bruno that he had been convicted by a jury of his peers and that punishment was required.\\n\\n“You committed a crime,” the judge said. “The jury told you that. You can’t accept it. You have blinders on. You simply can’t see it.”\\n\\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Judge Sharpe ordered Mr. Bruno to pay $280,000 in restitution and to serve three years’ probation.\\n\\nProsecutors had asked that Mr. Bruno, 81, be sentenced to more than eight years in prison, arguing that he had abused the public trust to enrich himself. He faced a maximum of 20 years after he was convicted in December on federal corruption charges for concealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments received from a businessman who wanted help from the Legislature.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nHis lawyers had asked Judge Sharpe to consider a sentence without any jail time, arguing that financial restitution and a large fine were punishment enough for an elderly man and Army veteran still beloved by many in the capital region.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nIn court on Thursday, one of Mr. Bruno’s lawyers, William J. Dreyer, said that the prosecutors’ recommendations were “ridiculously harsh” and suggested that they were trying to sentence Mr. Bruno for crimes, like bribery or extortion, for which he had neither been indicted nor convicted.\\n\\n“Don’t sentence Joe Bruno for the sins of Albany,” Mr. Dreyer said.\\n\\nBut Judge Sharpe said Mr. Bruno’s age, health and accomplishments did not merit any departure from the sentence recommended by prosecutors and castigated the former senator for his repeated insistence, in public and in court, that he had committed no crime.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

Hartunian, the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, pronounced himself satisfied at a news conference inside the courthouse.\\n\\n“The imposition of sentence is a landmark step in holding Mr. Bruno accountable for his crimes,” Mr. Hartunian said. “We respect the sentence and trust that it reflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the law, provides just punishment, and deters others from corruption.”\\n\\nLooming over the Bruno case, however, is the Supreme Court review of three cases concerning the federal law under which Mr. Bruno was convicted. It makes it a crime “to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services” and is often used to prosecute corporate executives and politicians.\\n\\nWhen the cases were argued before the Supreme Court in December and March, several justices questioned whether the law was unconstitutionally vague. The three cases involve Jeffrey K. Skilling, a former chief executive of Enron; Conrad M. Black, a former newspaper executive; and Bruce Weyhrauch, a former Alaska legislator, and are expected to be decided before the court’s summer recess at the end of June.\\n\\nMr. Hartunian would not say if he was concerned that the law might be overturned and destroy the prosecutors’ case against Mr. Bruno. \"I think it’s clear that when the Supreme Court issues a decision, the court will call us back in to make a judgment,\" he said.\\n\\nThe sentence punctuated but did not end a legal story that began when Mr. Bruno was still in office and pulled back the curtain on the sometimes unsavory ways in which Albany lawmakers mix their official duties and private business.\\n\\nIn a monthlong trial, prosecutors presented evidence concerning a wide array of business activities Mr. Bruno conducted while Senate leader, including consulting contracts with companies seeking state business or help with regulators, his work with an investment firm seeking pension fund investments from New York unions with business before the Legislature, and investments in thoroughbred racehorses.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nMr. Bruno and his lawyers at times clashed openly with Judge Sharpe, who on one occasion abruptly sent the jury out of the room and chastised Mr. Bruno for speaking out of turn. Those exchanges may become an issue in any appeal that Mr. Bruno might file.\\n\\nUltimately, a jury acquitted Mr. Bruno of six counts of honest services fraud. But he was convicted on two counts involving his relationship with Jared E. Abbruzzese, an Albany-area entrepreneur who sought his help for an array of ventures, including a nanotechnology company seeking state money and telecommunications companies seeking investment capital.\\n\\nThe jurors found that Mr. Bruno had improperly concealed $200,000 in fees paid to the senator in 2004 by consulting firms run by Mr. Abbruzzese, and violating the law a year later, when Mr. Abbruzzese forgave Mr. Bruno $40,000 in debt and paid him $40,000 for a horse that prosecutors said was almost worthless.'"

Protesters chanted “Senate not for sale” and banged on the chamber’s windows while Republicans tried to convene. And the Republicans’ vow to resume the session fizzled after one of the two dissident Democrats they were depending on for a quorum, Hiram Monserrate of Queens, walked out of the chamber shortly after the proceedings began.\\n\\n“The dysfunction and chaos in the Senate has wasted an entire week of the people’s business,” a clearly irritated Gov. David A. Paterson said in a statement released Thursday. He has been largely relegated to the sidelines during the dispute.\\n\\nBy day’s end, it was clear that the balance of power in the state’s upper house — and the very gears of state government — continued to rest in the hands of Mr. Monserrate, who was indicted in March on charges of slashing his female companion with a broken glass.\\n\\nAs he was leaving the Senate chamber, a Republican staff member dashed after him, pleading, “Senator, we need you back in there.” But Mr. Monserrate said he was committed to recruiting more Democrats to join the coalition and would be holding meetings all day in hopes of doing so, even as those Democrats were simultaneously trying to woo him back to their side.\\n\\n“This chamber must not remain divided,” he said. “You can’t have coalition government with 2 Democrats and 30 Republicans.”\\n\\nThere were many other developments throughout the day.\\n\\nThe Senate’s new president, Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat sharing power with Republicans, tried to lure his former Democratic colleagues back to the chamber by offering to bring same-sex marriage legislation to the Senate floor next week, for the first time in the Senate’s history.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nHis comments prompted the Senate’s only openly gay member, Thomas K. Duane, to say he was open to abandoning the Democratic caucus, a day after his staff insisted he was staying put. “Today, I’m in the Democratic conference, and I’m a Democrat,” he added. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone what’s going to happen when everyone comes back on Monday.”</td>\n",

       "14  As lawyers for both sides prepared for another round of legal sparring, Senate Democrats were planning to meet Friday afternoon in Manhattan to discuss how they can move forward after a devastating week. Support within the Democratic conference for its current leader, Malcolm A. Smith of Queens, has been eroding since the Republicans displaced the party from power on Monday.\\n\\nDuring their meeting, senators are expected to discuss whether to remove Mr. Smith and install someone else. Support for Senator John L. Sampson of Brooklyn as leader has been building in recent days, according to some Democrats. But other senators, including Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, are said to be interested in the position, said some Democrats, who spoke anonymously to discuss private internal talks.\\n\\nBy comparison, Friday was a sedate day in the Capitol after pandemonium reigned for most of the week.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Protesters chanted “Senate not for sale” and banged on the chamber’s windows while Republicans tried to convene. And the Republicans’ vow to resume the session fizzled after one of the two dissident Democrats they were depending on for a quorum, Hiram Monserrate of Queens, walked out of the chamber shortly after the proceedings began.\\n\\n“The dysfunction and chaos in the Senate has wasted an entire week of the people’s business,” a clearly irritated Gov. David A. Paterson said in a statement released Thursday. He has been largely relegated to the sidelines during the dispute.\\n\\nBy day’s end, it was clear that the balance of power in the state’s upper house — and the very gears of state government — continued to rest in the hands of Mr. Monserrate, who was indicted in March on charges of slashing his female companion with a broken glass.\\n\\nAs he was leaving the Senate chamber, a Republican staff member dashed after him, pleading, “Senator, we need you back in there.” But Mr. Monserrate said he was committed to recruiting more Democrats to join the coalition and would be holding meetings all day in hopes of doing so, even as those Democrats were simultaneously trying to woo him back to their side.\\n\\n“This chamber must not remain divided,” he said. “You can’t have coalition government with 2 Democrats and 30 Republicans.”\\n\\nThere were many other developments throughout the day.\\n\\nThe Senate’s new president, Pedro Espada Jr., a Bronx Democrat sharing power with Republicans, tried to lure his former Democratic colleagues back to the chamber by offering to bring same-sex marriage legislation to the Senate floor next week, for the first time in the Senate’s history.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nHis comments prompted the Senate’s only openly gay member, Thomas K. Duane, to say he was open to abandoning the Democratic caucus, a day after his staff insisted he was staying put. “Today, I’m in the Democratic conference, and I’m a Democrat,” he added. “There’s no way to predict what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone what’s going to happen when everyone comes back on Monday.”   \n",

       "592  New York State voters overwhelmingly disagree with the Cuomo administration’s policy of automatically deleting state workers’ emails after 90 days, according to a poll released Monday.\\n\\nEighty percent of voters said emails should be saved for a significantly longer period of time, according to the poll, which was conducted by Siena College. Only 16 percent supported the speedy email purges.\\n\\nIn Albany, the email policy has drawn loud criticism in recent weeks from government watchdog groups as well as some lawmakers, who have proposed legislation to stop the email purges. The policy has also reinforced Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s reputation for seeking to tightly control information, a defining trait of his administration.\\n\\nUnder increasing pressure, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, suggested this month that he would consider adopting a new policy, but only if the Legislature agreed to provide the public with greater access to its records. Last week, skeptical of the governor’s intentions, groups that advocate government transparency urged Mr. Cuomo to put an immediate stop to the email purges.   \n",

Much of the talk focused on the officials who represent parts of the city like the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn and central Queens, where Mr. Lipsky was actively involved in land-use debates, particularly in efforts to derail development projects.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nAsked if he was bracing for another wave of allegations, City Councilman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx, a former state attorney general, laughed and said: “Would I be surprised? No.”\\n\\nHe also welcomed any information that could be provided by Mr. Lipsky. “As long as he provides reliable information, it’s a very good thing,” Mr. Koppell said. “We’ve got to get rid of that kind of corruption in our politics.” In Albany, the list of scandals has been long. The Kruger case, as well as sexual harassment allegations against Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, have been among the most prominent, but a number of other lawmakers are also under investigation: Senator Shirley L. Huntley, a Queens Democrat, was indicted last month on charges of taking part in a scheme to steal taxpayer money meant for a nonprofit group she had founded, while Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, is being investigated for misusing taxpayer money. Both lost primaries this month.\\n\\nAt the City Council, two members have run afoul of the law in recent years after city and federal investigations into the Council’s corruption-plagued and long-opaque process of doling out discretionary funds. One, Miguel Martinez, is serving a five-year prison term for absconding with $106,000, some of which was intended for nonprofit groups. Another, Larry B. Seabrook, was convicted in July of nine counts of fraud for orchestrating a corruption scheme to channel hundreds of thousands of dollars in city money to his relatives and friends.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Cuomo, a Democrat. But the list of allegations of wrongdoing has continued to grow.\\n\\n“There’s too much of an incestuous relationship between lobbyists, elected officials and donors,” said State Senator Tony Avella, a first-term Democrat from Queens who previously served on the City Council. Assessing the extent to which lawmakers had cleaned up Albany, Mr. Avella said, “We haven’t even made a dent.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nNone of the elected officials interviewed said they would be surprised to see colleagues charged.\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” said City Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn, “that’s the track record.”</td>\n",

Much of the talk focused on the officials who represent parts of the city like the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn and central Queens, where Mr. Lipsky was actively involved in land-use debates, particularly in efforts to derail development projects.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nAsked if he was bracing for another wave of allegations, City Councilman G. Oliver Koppell of the Bronx, a former state attorney general, laughed and said: “Would I be surprised? No.”\\n\\nHe also welcomed any information that could be provided by Mr. Lipsky. “As long as he provides reliable information, it’s a very good thing,” Mr. Koppell said. “We’ve got to get rid of that kind of corruption in our politics.” In Albany, the list of scandals has been long. The Kruger case, as well as sexual harassment allegations against Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, have been among the most prominent, but a number of other lawmakers are also under investigation: Senator Shirley L. Huntley, a Queens Democrat, was indicted last month on charges of taking part in a scheme to steal taxpayer money meant for a nonprofit group she had founded, while Assemblywoman Naomi Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, is being investigated for misusing taxpayer money. Both lost primaries this month.\\n\\nAt the City Council, two members have run afoul of the law in recent years after city and federal investigations into the Council’s corruption-plagued and long-opaque process of doling out discretionary funds. One, Miguel Martinez, is serving a five-year prison term for absconding with $106,000, some of which was intended for nonprofit groups. Another, Larry B. Seabrook, was convicted in July of nine counts of fraud for orchestrating a corruption scheme to channel hundreds of thousands of dollars in city money to his relatives and friends.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She would not be surprised, she said, if Mr. Lipsky tried to reveal “some sordid and/or illegal relationships,” given his extensive dealings with the City Council and the number of big projects the Council has debated.\\n\\n“A lot of people are bracing themselves for what tomorrow holds,” Ms. James said. “I just hope it’s not any of my colleagues.”\\n\\nIn recent years there has been a steady stream of candidates running for office on a platform of removing the taint of corruption from politics in New York City and in Albany, including the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
